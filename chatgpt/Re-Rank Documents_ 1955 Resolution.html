from the American South.</p></li><li><p>"Americo-Liberian.txt" - While this document is about the Americo-Liberian people, who have historical ties to the United States and may have influenced the architecture in Monrovia, it is less directly relevant to the architectural features mentioned in the clue.</p></li><li><p>"Urbanization in Africa.txt" - This document likely discusses broader topics
